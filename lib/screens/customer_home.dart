// REMOVED: this file was a duplicate/shim for `customer_home_new.dart`.
// Keeping a minimal placeholder prevents accidental import breakage in
// older code that may reference the path. The canonical implementation
// is `customer_home_new.dart` — consider updating imports and removing
// this file entirely when you're ready.

// NOTE: The user requested deletion of this duplicate file. If you want
// it fully removed from the repository, delete this file after updating
// any import sites that reference it.
